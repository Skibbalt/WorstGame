This is just a word of caution from Siena. 
If we're presenting our game in the Unity Editor, ignore this.
If the game is built without Siena's notice and be put onto the Itch Page, some scripts MAY need to be slightly adjusted.
It just has to do with quitting the Unity Playing Editor. It would just be replaced with "Application.Quit" instead. 
The scripts that would need to adjusted would be: Star_Image, GameManager, and Quit_Button
